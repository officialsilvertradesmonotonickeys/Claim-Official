In delegated voting, the proxy is transitive
and the transfer recursive. Put simply, 
the vote may be further delegated to the proxy's proxy,
and so on. This is also called transitive proxy, 
delegable proxy and delegate cascade. 

Delegate voting is used by 
the direct vote overrules 
the proxy vote. It is also 
possible to change the proxy 
at any time.

Use PageRank for the processing 
of the transitive proxy votes, with 
the additional constraints of mandating 
at least two initial proxies 
per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates.

More complex variants can be built on top of PageRank, such as 
adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues
PageRank as the underlying umbrella system,
mandates that generalist proxies should always be used.

Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament 
Experiment, and in implementations of delegative 
democracy, which is also known as liquid democracy.
